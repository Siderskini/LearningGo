# Generic Fishing Game
Making a generic fishing game with ebitengine. Code contains excerpts edited from https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/tree/main/examples/.
The purpose of this project is to create the generic building blocks for a game:
- Title screen
- Menu with buttons
- Save functionality
- Animations
- Audio

There is a possibility of expanding this scope in the future. As buiding blocks are made, they will be added to gamecommon for use in future projects.
